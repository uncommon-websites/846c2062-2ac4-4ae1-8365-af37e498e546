    "prompt": "Documentary-style editorial photograph of a professional woman in a serene yoga pose within an elegant, softly lit studio. The environment features warm, natural morning light streaming through windows, with subtle amber highlights from a nearby desk lamp reflecting off wood or leather surfaces. The composition uses generous negative space in newsprint grays, with the subject off-center and framed by architectural elements like doorways or window frames. The focus is shallow, isolating the subject from a softly blurred, curated background. Her expression is one of calm clarity and quiet confidence, embodying a sense of poised insight. No technology, screens, text, or abstract elements are present. The overall mood is editorial sophistication and contemplative mastery, with authentic skin tones and warm, earth-toned accents in the environment.",

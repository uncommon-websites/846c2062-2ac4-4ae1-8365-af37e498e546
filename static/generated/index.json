    "prompt": "Documentary-style editorial photograph of a professional woman in a serene yoga pose within an elegant, softly lit studio. The environment features warm, natural morning light streaming through windows, with subtle amber highlights from a nearby desk lamp reflecting off wood or leather surfaces.

The focus is shallow, isolating the subject from a softly blurred, curated background. Her expression is one of calm clarity and quiet confidence, embodying a sense of poised insight. No technology, screens, text, or abstract elements are present.
